Revision history for Perl extension WiringPi::API.

2.36.3  2017-01-22

        - changed TOC to "TABLE OF CONTENTS" in POD (closes #18)
        - modified dist description in POD
        - added blurb in softpwm section that this functionality is quite
          unreliable
        - removed the code that skipped over the first interrupt in XS, as
          the new wiringPi corrected the issue internally
        - added POD for ads1115_setup()
        - added test file for wiringPi's representation of the ADS1115 ADC
        - added support for communicating on the SPI bus (spi_setup() and
          spi_data()
        - added spiDataRW() (C), which wraps wiringPiSPIDataRW() so that we
          can accept an AV* (aref) before transforming it into the proper 
          unsigned char* before sending it to wiringPiSPIDataRW()

2.36.2  2017-01-19
        - added function table of contents to POD
        - added declaration of custom wiringPiVersion() in XS, but left it
          commented out as it will break CPAN installs at this time
        - added version.patch file in patches/, patch sent to Gordon
        - all four setup routines added to test/setup.pl
        - added in wiringPi's support for the Adafruit ADS1115 analog to digital
          converter (I'm going to do a rewrite of this code to support 1015, as
          well as allowing all ADC options to be configurable, and hope it gets
          included in the next wiringPi cut)
        - added docs/, which includes Fritzing diagrams and schematics
        - added DEVELOPER FUNCTIONS section in POD for dev testing of private,
          unpublished or unreleased functions
        - added pseudoPinsSetup() for testing purposes
        - reworded POD for setup() routines, as we no longer require root level
          access to run our scripts (yay!)
        - wrote test/pwm.pl, fully tests the hardware PWM functionality
        - added test/pud.pl, testing for pull up/down internal resistors
        - changed board_rev() references in POD to gpio_layout() (fixes #9)
        - added test/pin_translations.pl, test all pin translation functions
        - added pinModeAlt() as a developer function (allows setting any pin to
          any valid mode)
        - added digitalReadByte(), digitalReadByte2(), digitalWriteByte() and
          digitalWriteByte2() as developer functions. Reads and writes an 8-bit
          byte to/from the first and second bank of eight GPIO pins respectively
        - added setup tests, since an issue was found that causes some calls to
          crash the system (journal, RO), added root checks. Notes taken on
          sourcing the issue(s)

2.36.1  2017-01-15
        - changed version numbering scheme. x.yy.z: x.yy represents the version
          of wiringPi we fully support, and z represents updates to this Perl
          distribution
        - renamed examples/ to samples/ so they don't show up on the CPAN's
          front page for the distribution
        - added exports for physPinToWpi() and phys_to_wpi() to correct a test
          breakage
        
2.36    2017-01-14
        - major updates, we now require wiringPi v2.36+
        - changed version numbering scheme. We now match the wiringPi version
          number that we fully support
        - changed piBoardRev() to piGpioLayout(), and board_rev() to 
          gpio_laout() per changes in wiringPi.c/h
        - added analogRead()/analog_read() and analogWrite()/analog_write() to
          support the BMP180 sensor
        - added bmp180_setup()/bmp180Setup()
        - added bmp180_temp() and bmp180_pressure()
        - added POD for all the new functionality

1.05    2017-01-13
        - added support for the SR74HC595 shift register (shift_reg_setup() for
          Perl, and the original sr595Setup())
        - added examples/sr.pl for the shift register code

1.04    2016-08-22
        - implemented softPwmCreate(), softPwmWrite() and softPwmStop(), perl:
          soft_pwm_create(), soft_pwm_write(), soft_pwm_stop()
        - interrupts now work; added code to stop the erroneous extra call to
          the handler on first interrupt

1.03    2016-08-18
        - fixed call to SetupGpio(), case was wrong
        - renamed gpio_scheme() call to pin_scheme()
        - removed erroneous call to external module (pin_scheme())
        - POD cleanup, re-worded $pin descriptions, and fixed up setup*()
          routine explanations

1.02    2016-08-16
        - removed references to wiringPi pin numbering scheme being the default
        - added clarification in setup*() routine POD

1.00    2016-08-16
        - new export tags, :wiringPi exports the originally named wiringPi
          functions directly from XS. :perl exports the Perl representation
          of the functions, and :all exports them all
        - setup_sys() now exports all BCM pins with a system call with sudo,
          which alleviates the need to run as user root
        - interrupt code now implemented and working
        - renamed to WiringPi::API

0.06    2016-08-13
        - moved arg validation out of Core and into upper-layer client
          software. The idea is to keep this module as close to the C code
          as possible, so if this module is used directly, C will handle the
          problem
        - wrote custom physPinToWpi() C function, and added a phys_to_wpi()
          caller
        - we now shift off the object or class name if it is present in all
          sub calls
        - all parameter error handling out, and put it into the upper layers...
          we now pretty much call the C functions directly with little overhead

0.05    2016-08-11
        - added all of the wiringPiDev shared library LCD functions, and
          mapped them in ::Core

0.04    2016-08-10
        - wiringPiSetupPhys() has been implemented
        - added piBoardRev(), wpiPinToGpio(), physPinToGpio() and pwmSetRange()
          functions
        - added Perl->C mappings in POD

0.03    2016-08-10
        - added repo info to Makefile.PL
        - added get_alt(), maps to C getAlt(). This returns the current mode
          of a pin. Why it's not called getMode() is beyond me ;)

0.02    2016-08-10
        - added notices to POD
        - added POD for pwm_write()

0.01    2016-08-10
        - separated out from RPi::WiringPi
        - most core and system functions implemented
